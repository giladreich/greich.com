# Qt Direct3D / DirectX Widget

This project contains Direct3D/DirectX widgets to use within the Qt Framework for DirectX 9, 10, 11 and 12.

There are also Direct3D widgets that supports [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), so you can decide whether you want to use only Direct3D widget or Direct3D widget with ImGui.


## Getting Started

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/giladreich/QtDirect3D`

Under the `src` directory you'll find the widgets sources for each version. If you want the ImGui widget, you'll find it under `src/QDirect3D*Widget/ImGui`.

Under the `examples` directory there are few samples to demonstrate how to interact with the widget and how easy it is to get started.

When you start a new `Qt GUI Application` project, do the following steps:

* Copy the widget you want to use into your project and add it as existing item.
* In your `MainWindow.ui` file you'll need to promote the `centeralWidget` when you start a fresh project so it will draw the Direct3D widget.
* Compile and run. 

At this point you should have a basic Direct3D scene.

NOTE: If you're using the demo projects, make sure you have `$(QTDIR)` environment variable to the qt version/kit you have.

### Using the Widget

In the `MainWindow.h` file, you'll need to create 3(4 if using ImGui) slots:
```cpp
public slots:
	bool init(bool success);
	void tick();
	void render();
	void uiRender(); // ImGui
```

In your `MainWindow.cpp` file, connect the signals and slots with the widget:
```cpp
connect(ui->view, &QDirect3D11Widget::deviceInitialized, this, &MainWindow::init);
connect(ui->view, &QDirect3D11Widget::ticked, this, &MainWindow::tick);
connect(ui->view, &QDirect3D11Widget::rendered, this, &MainWindow::render);
connect(ui->view, &QDirect3D11Widget::uiRendered, this, &MainWindow::uiRender);
```

Then do your own implemenetation to the following slots:
* `init` - Additional initialization. True is passed from the widget if the 3d device and scene successfully created.
* `tick` - Scene update (i.e moving vertices positions).
* `render` - Drawing.
* `uiRender` - ImGui widgets drawing.

At this point everything should be up and running.

##### Handling close event

To properly clean up the application, we override the [closeEvent](http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qcloseevent.html), call `release` and give it at least 500 milliseconds delay before we close the application:

```cpp
void MainWindow::closeEvent(QCloseEvent * event)
{
	event->ignore();

	ui->view->release();
	m_bWindowClosing = true;
	QTime dieTime = QTime::currentTime().addMSecs(500);
	while (QTime::currentTime() < dieTime)
		QCoreApplication::processEvents(QEventLoop::AllEvents, 100);

	event->accept();
}
```

### Prerequisites

* Qt msvc compiler (I use msvc141, but should work also with older versions).
* Qt VS Plugin(if you want to use the VS solutions). You could also load the demos in `QtCreator` by loading the `CMakeLists.txt` in the root of the project.

## Show Case

Using the widget with ImGui and creating a scene:

## Motivation

I've been working with [MFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library) GUI Applications for quite a while now and at the same time used Qt.

When it comes to Desktop GUI Application, I think there is no question or doubt that using Qt is the best decision for many reasons.

In my spare time I made few more projects using the MFC framework because they are easier to use when working with the WinAPI, because I wanted to render 3D stuff using DirectX.

Qt always seem to me more of an OpenGL thing, the fact that they only provide `QOpenGLWidget` build-in and not `QDirect3DWidget` and it's based on OpenGL in general.

I therefore decided to challenge myself using DirectX in Qt and was happy to see the end-results.
